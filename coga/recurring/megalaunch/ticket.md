## Description

Attempt launchable active Coga work sequentially. This is a script-backed
recurring task, not a parallel agent fanout: it calls the shared megalaunch
engine used by `coga megalaunch`, checks each assigned agent's budget guard
before launching, and stops or skips conservatively when work is blocked,
human-owned, over budget, or fails a launch preflight. The engine spawns
each step as a normal interactive launch under the PTY watcher, so it
requires a TTY — a headless scheduled run fails loud (exit 2) instead of
launching silent agents.

Each run writes one compact `## Megalaunch Run Summary` section to its
blackboard with counts and per-ticket outcomes. The summary is replaced on
rerun so old per-run noise does not accumulate in future prompts; unresolved
blockers stay on the affected task blackboards.

<!-- coga:blackboard -->

This blackboard persists across every run of this recurring task. The
`coga/megalaunch/run` script replaces `## Megalaunch Run Summary` each run
and leaves durable decisions or unresolved blockers in their own sections.
